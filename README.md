# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a simulation of four CPU scheduling algorithms:
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2. Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
3. Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT)
4. Round Robin (RR)

## Features
- Supports user input for process details.
- Displays a Gantt chart for each scheduling algorithm.
- Calculates waiting and turnaround times.

## How to Run the Program
### **Using g++ (for C++)**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator


Example 
    Enter number of processes: 4
Enter Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time:
P1 0 8
P2 1 4
P3 2 9
P4 3 5
Enter Time Quantum (for RR only): 3
